# [Study Room Collaboration](https://msichterman.github.io/study-room-collaboration/index.html)
A study room planning software intended to improve the reservation experience by allowing users to create open study rooms, and join other study rooms with people studying the same subjects.

## Motivation
I created this site because I wanted to take an idea from my Human Computer Interaction(HCI) class and transfer it to a fully functional website. In class, my group was tasked to complete various steps in order to develop the best possible interface. First, we completed contexual inquiry interviews to understand how students use the current study room reservation software. We then used data from the interviews to create a paper prototype of our initial system. From there, we created three specific tasks which we gave to users in order to conduct a task analysis study. This study gave us enough information to continue to the next step, which was the implementation of our [computer prototype](https://msichterman.github.io/study-room-collaboration/ComputerPrototype).
